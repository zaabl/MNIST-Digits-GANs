# MNIST-Digits-GANs
In this repository, an implementation of multiple GANs networks are incremented, it includes a linear implementation, then a batch normalaization layer added, then a deep convolution network, then lastly a custom spectral normalization is both implemented and used.

## How to Run
Each script is designed to run on its on, just don't forget to change the 'device' variable to either 'cpu' if you are going to run on your CPU or to 'cuda' if you are going to run it on your GPU.
